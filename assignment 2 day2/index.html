    </p>
    
    <ul>

    <h3>Subjects Of Study</h3>
    <p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:<ol>
    <li> Turning H₂O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H1203.)</li>
    <li> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 increasing to 3 x 104.)
    </li>
    <li> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 increasing to 3 x 104.)
     </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Please provide more information about these subjects.including how you long you'd expect the research to take else you think we'd need to know? Thanks. </p> <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
    <p>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>
    <dl>
    <dt>Polynesian Chicken Dances</dt>
    <dd>
    A Little Known but <em>very</em> infiluential dance dating as far as 308 <abbr title="BC">BC</abbr>whole village around the circle like chicken.
    </dd>
    <dt>Icelanders brownian shuffle</dt>
    <dd>
    Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
    </dd>
    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>
    An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.
